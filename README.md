Hello, Adina and Blamah collaborated together to create the A.B. calculator for our apprenticeship project.

 Adina Younus being the host of the repository. This calculator was made with HTML, CSS and JS.

Project Features
* Grid display
* The use of Javascript functions, methods and arrays.
* Designed Form and buttons
* Made accessible for different device sizes.

We utilitzed github collobration to create this calculator. The use of grid to layout and format the calculator. To make the calculator work, we created functions for the operations and utlizied serveral methods such as pop(), join() and slice () to clear and add numbers. 

The use of numbers into strings were placed in a array so the computer can look at each number individually while looking for the operator and exuecutes the calculation with a for loop.
